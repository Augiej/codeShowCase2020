These different python classes were written to be used in real time with a gyro intertial measurement unit, sonar detectors, and indoor gps for my junior year integration project. 
These functions were executed on a Rasberry Pi.

RemoteControl is a function that would enable the user to control the robot with a keyboard.

NavigationWithObstacleCheck was the navigation function that would actively read in values from the distance sensors, IMU, and gps 
to redirect the robot around the correct path while avoiding obstacles.

The other files supported these funcions.
